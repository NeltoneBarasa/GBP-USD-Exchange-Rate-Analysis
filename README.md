# GBP-USD-Exchange-Rate-Analysis

This project explores the application of the ARIMA model for forecasting the GBP/USD exchange rate, aiming to enhance financial decision-making by providing accurate and reliable predictions. Exchange rate forecasting is crucial for investors, policymakers, and businesses as it influences international trade, investment decisions, and economic planning. However, the volatile nature of currency markets makes prediction challenging. This study addresses this challenge by leveraging historical exchange rate data and applying time series analysis techniques to capture underlying patterns and trends.

The methodology involves preprocessing the data to ensure stationarity and eliminating noise that could affect model accuracy. The ARIMA model was selected due to its proven effectiveness in time series forecasting. Model parameters were optimized using autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses, followed by model training and validation. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to assess model performance and select the most accurate and efficient model configuration.

The results of this study demonstrate the ARIMA modelâ€™s capability in forecasting exchange rates with high accuracy and reliability. The model effectively captured temporal dependencies and provided robust predictions, supporting informed financial decisions. This project contributes to the field of financial forecasting by demonstrating how advanced time series models can be leveraged to navigate the complexities of currency market fluctuations. The findings can be utilized by traders, investors, and financial analysts to enhance their strategic planning and risk management.
